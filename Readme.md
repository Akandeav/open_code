# Open Code
Open Code is a chrome extension that displays all active github repository tabs in a chrome window. It allows the user to open any of these active tabs in vscode web.

## Background
A quick background to why I made this. Over a couple months, I had to do a lot of development on my browser without having any code on my local machine. The experience was nice since I could code on any computer available. However, I experienced challenges when I had to browse through projects that had a lot of directories and sub directories. It was painful.  
Fortunately, Microsoft has a chrome extension that opens a github repo in vscode web but I had always wanted to learn how to build a chrome extension and besides the extension by microsoft only worked if the repo's tab was in focus. I thought it would be nice to have an extension that shows all the tabs and let's you open that tab from anywhere in the chrome window. Besides, I wanted to experience learning how to build a chrome extension. So I followed the google [documentation]("https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/") and here we are the intial version.  

## USAGE
At the moment this extension is available in developer view. The extension will be published on the chrome web store soon.  
Thank you.
